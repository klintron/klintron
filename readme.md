Hi, I'm Senior Content Writer at GitHub. Previously, I spent eight years as a writer for _Wired_ where I covered open source software, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and developer technologies. My other writing credits include stints at _ReadWriteWeb_ and _TechCrunch_. Before my journalism career I did IT help desk support for a non-profit organization.

I live in Portland, OR with my wife and our cats. When I'm not pacing around the house trying to think of words to type, I enjoy hiking, tabletop role playing games, reading crime fiction, and music (mostly post-punk, metal, and noise rock). My background is in journalism, not computer science, but I've cobbled together a few tiny JavaScript programs just to learn. I'm messing around with Python at the moment.

I'm always on the lookout for new story ideas, so feel free to email me at klintron@github.com.
