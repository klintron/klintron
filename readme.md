Hi, I'm Senior Editor of GitHub's publication The ReadME Project. Before joining GitHub I spent eight years as a writer for _Wired_ where I covered open source software, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and developer technologies. My other writing credits include stints at _ReadWriteWeb_ and _TechCrunch_ along with articles for _Boing Boing_ and _Oregon Business_. Before my journalism career I did IT help desk support for a non-profit.

I live in Portland, OR with my wife and our cats. When I'm not pacing around the house trying to think of words to type, I enjoy hiking, tabletop role playing games, and music (mostly post-punk, metal, and noise rock). My background is in journalism, not computer science, but I have cobbled together a few tiny JavaScript programs just to learn. I'm messing around with Python and Haskell at the moment.

I'm always on the lookout for new story ideas, so feel free to email me at klintron@github.com.
